# Veezy for iPad

This is the code for the Veezy iPad app, available at https://itunes.apple.com/pt/app/veezy-simple-slideshow/id1283387998

**NOTE**: I've since removed the app from the App Store for ideological reasons. You can find a web app (client-only and free) that does the same as this one did, [here](https://github.com/BrunoBernardino/photo-frame).

It's open for everyone to contribute to.

This is only my second Swift project, and 4th iOS app.

If there are suggestions, I'd appreciate them!

If you find value in this, [donate some cryptocurrency](https://gist.github.com/BrunoBernardino/ff5b54c13dd96ac7f9fee6fbfd825b09).
